# DATA-EPS-DOEs
Experimental data obtained in the laboratory of the polytechnic for the thesis. Analysis and data of multifocal lenses and other diffractive optical elements.

In the Multifocal lenses folder we have 4 subfolders where we have the txt and .npy files obtained experimentally and some PNG images obtained in the laboratory.
- DE at focal point": Folder containing the arrays [Exposure time, Intensity of the diffracted light at focal point] for different lenses. In these files, in order to keep them organised, they are named with the date and information about the phase of the lens used.
- DE axial coordinate": Analogous folder to the previous one but saving the arrays [Axial coordinate z, Average diffracted intensity].
- LensesProfiles": Folder containing the profiles of the lenses captured in the image plane. Also, axial slices of the lenses are presented, in order to analyze their profile.
